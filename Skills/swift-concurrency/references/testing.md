# Testing concurrent code

Best practices for testing Swift Concurrency with Swift Testing (recommended) and XCTest.


## Async tests with Swift Testing

Swift Testing supports async test functions natively. No special setup:

```swift
@Test func userLoads() async throws {
    let user = try await UserService().load(id: "123")
    #expect(user.name == "Alice")
}
```

Do not wrap async work in `Task {}` or use expectations/semaphores inside Swift Testing tests — just make the test function `async`.


## Testing actor state

Access actor properties through `await` in tests, just like production code. Do not bypass actor isolation with `nonisolated` accessors added just for testing.

```swift
@Test func cachingWorks() async throws {
    let cache = ImageCache()
    let image = try await cache.image(for: testURL)
    let cached = try await cache.image(for: testURL)
    #expect(image == cached)
}
```


## The `.serialized` trait and concurrent tests

Swift Testing runs tests in parallel by default, which is usually what you want for concurrency code.

**Important:** `.serialized` only affects parameterized tests. It tells Swift Testing to run a test's argument cases one at a time rather than in parallel. Applying `.serialized` to a non-parameterized test does nothing. Applying it to a whole suite only serializes the parameterized tests inside that suite; other tests are unaffected.

Agents frequently assume `.serialized` works on any test. It does not.

```swift
@Test(.serialized, arguments: ["alice", "bob", "charlie"])
func userCreation(username: String) async throws {
    let user = try await UserService().create(username: username)
    #expect(user.isActive)
}
```


## Confirmation for async events

When testing that an async event fires (callback, notification, stream value), use `confirmation()`:

```swift
@Test func notificationFires() async {
    await confirmation { confirmed in
        // Start listening before posting, and yield to ensure the for-await
        // loop is actually iterating before the notification is sent. Without
        // the yield, the post can arrive before the listener is ready, making
        // the test flaky.
        let task = Task {
            for await _ in NotificationCenter.default.notifications(named: .dataDidChange) {
                confirmed()
                break
            }
        }

        // Give the task a chance to reach its first suspension.
        await Task.yield()

        NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .dataDidChange, object: nil)
        await task.value
    }
}
```

`confirmation()` fails the test if the closure is never called, replacing the old XCTest pattern of `XCTestExpectation` + `wait(for:timeout:)`.

**Important:** All async work being confirmed must complete before the `confirmation()` closure returns. If the code under test spawns an internal `Task` and the test cannot await it, `confirmation()` will finish before the work does and the test will fail. Either make the production API `async` so the test can await it directly, or have it return its `Task` handle so the test can call `await task.value` before the closure ends.


## Actor isolation in tests

By default, Swift Testing runs tests on any executor it chooses. Constrain this when testing code that requires specific actor isolation:

```swift
@MainActor
@Test func viewModelUpdatesOnMainActor() async {
    let vm = ViewModel()
    await vm.refresh()
    #expect(vm.items.isEmpty == false)
}
```

For finer control, `confirmation()` and `withKnownIssue()` accept an `isolation` parameter — that closure runs on a specific actor while the rest of the test runs elsewhere:

```swift
@Test func loadingUpdatesUI() async {
    await confirmation(isolation: MainActor.shared) { confirmed in
        let vm = ViewModel(onUpdate: { confirmed() })
        await vm.load()
    }
}
```

Test targets can have default actor isolation enabled at the module level. When reviewing test failures around isolation, check the target's build settings.


## Test scoping traits with `@TaskLocal`

**Requires Swift 6.1 or later.**

When multiple tests need a shared configuration (mock environment, injected dependency), test scoping traits provide a concurrency-safe way to set it up using task-local values rather than shared mutable state.

Create a type conforming to `TestTrait` and `TestScoping`, then set the task-local value inside `provideScope()`:

```swift
struct MockEnvironmentTrait: TestTrait, TestScoping {
    func provideScope(
        for test: Test,
        testCase: Test.Case?,
        performing function: () async throws -> Void
    ) async throws {
        let env = Environment(apiBase: URL(string: "https://test.example.com")!)

        try await Environment.$current.withValue(env) {
            try await function()
        }
    }
}

extension Trait where Self == MockEnvironmentTrait {
    static var mockEnvironment: Self { Self() }
}
```

Apply it to any test or suite:

```swift
@Test(.mockEnvironment) func fetchUsesTestAPI() async throws {
    // Environment.current is now the mock, scoped to this test's task.
    let users = try await UserService().fetchAll()
    #expect(users.isEmpty == false)
}
```

This avoids the concurrency hazards of a shared `setUp()` mutating global state. Each test's configuration lives in the task-local, so parallel tests get independent values automatically.

### Async teardown via scoping trait

Because `deinit` cannot call async methods, scoping traits are the preferred pattern for async cleanup:

```swift
struct DatabaseTrait: SuiteTrait, TestTrait, TestScoping {
    func provideScope(
        for test: Test,
        testCase: Test.Case?,
        performing function: () async throws -> Void
    ) async throws {
        let database = Database()
        try await Environment.$database.withValue(database) {
            await database.prepare()
            try await function()
            await database.cleanup() // Async teardown
        }
    }
}

@Suite(DatabaseTrait())
struct DatabaseTests {
    @Test func insertsData() async throws {
        try await Environment.database.insert(item)
    }
}
```


## Avoid timing-based tests

Never use `Task.sleep`, `Thread.sleep`, or fixed delays to "wait for something to happen." These tests are flaky — they may pass on fast machines but fail under load or on CI.

```swift
// BROKEN: relies on timing.
@Test func dataLoads() async throws {
    viewModel.load()
    try await Task.sleep(for: .seconds(1))
    #expect(viewModel.items.isEmpty == false)
}
```

Instead, await the actual async operation:

```swift
// CORRECT: awaits the real work.
@Test func dataLoads() async throws {
    await viewModel.load()
    #expect(viewModel.items.isEmpty == false)
}
```

If the API is callback-based, wrap it with `withCheckedContinuation` or use `confirmation()`.


## Testing cancellation

The goal is to verify that the *code under test* checks for cancellation, not just that `Task.checkCancellation()` works in a test harness. Design the test so the code under test is the thing that observes the cancellation flag.

Give the code under test a stream or signal it blocks on, cancel the task while it's suspended on that signal, then verify it exits with `CancellationError`:

```swift
@Test func processorRespectsCancel() async throws {
    // Processor.run() calls Task.checkCancellation() between items.
    let processor = Processor(items: Array(repeating: .stub, count: 1_000))

    let task = Task {
        try await processor.run()
    }

    // Let the processor start, then cancel.
    try await Task.sleep(for: .zero)
    task.cancel()

    await #expect(throws: CancellationError.self) {
        try await task.value
    }
}
```

If the code under test is a `for await` loop, cancel the consuming task and verify the loop exits. Key point: the test must exercise a cancellation check that lives in production code, not one you added to the test itself.


## Controlling execution with `withMainSerialExecutor`

Some tests need to observe intermediate state (e.g. `isLoading == true` during a fetch). Without serial execution, the task often races to completion before the assertion runs:

```swift
// Flaky — may pass or fail
@Test @MainActor func isLoadingState() async throws {
    let fetcher = ImageFetcher()
    let task = Task { try await fetcher.fetch(url) }
    #expect(fetcher.isLoading == true)  // Race
    try await task.value
    #expect(fetcher.isLoading == false)
}
```

With [swift-concurrency-extras](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-concurrency-extras), `withMainSerialExecutor` forces tasks to run serially on the main executor, making intermediate-state tests deterministic:

```swift
import ConcurrencyExtras

@Test @MainActor func isLoadingState() async throws {
    try await withMainSerialExecutor {
        let fetcher = ImageFetcher { url in
            await Task.yield()   // Allow test to observe state
            return Data()
        }

        let task = Task { try await fetcher.fetch(url) }
        await Task.yield()

        #expect(fetcher.isLoading == true)
        try await task.value
        #expect(fetcher.isLoading == false)
    }
}
```

Mark suites that rely on this with `.serialized` — the main serial executor does not coexist with parallel test execution. Only introduce this dependency when deterministic interleaving is genuinely required; prefer awaiting the real async operation.


## Testing memory management

Verify deallocation to catch retain cycles early:

```swift
@Test func viewModelDeallocates() async throws {
    var viewModel: ViewModel? = ViewModel()
    weak var weakViewModel = viewModel

    viewModel?.startWork()
    viewModel = nil

    try? await Task.sleep(for: .milliseconds(100))
    #expect(weakViewModel == nil)
}
```


## Race detection

Enable Thread Sanitizer (TSan) in your test scheme to catch data races at runtime. TSan finds races that compiler static checks often miss, particularly in code using `@unchecked Sendable` or unsafe pointers.

In Xcode: Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme → Diagnostics → Thread Sanitizer.

TSan adds overhead — enable it for a dedicated CI job rather than every local run.


## XCTest legacy patterns

If the project still has XCTest concurrency tests and full migration isn't feasible:

```swift
final class ArticleSearcherTests: XCTestCase {
    @MainActor
    func testEmptyQuery() async {
        let searcher = ArticleSearcher()
        await searcher.search("")
        XCTAssertEqual(searcher.results, ArticleSearcher.allArticles)
    }

    @MainActor
    func testSearchTask() async {
        let searcher = ArticleSearcher()
        let expectation = expectation(description: "Search complete")

        _ = withObservationTracking {
            searcher.results
        } onChange: {
            expectation.fulfill()
        }

        searcher.startSearchTask("swift")

        // Use fulfillment, not wait — wait(for:) deadlocks in async contexts.
        await fulfillment(of: [expectation], timeout: 10)
        XCTAssertEqual(searcher.results.count, 1)
    }
}
```

Setup/teardown can be async:

```swift
override func setUp() async throws { /* async setup */ }
override func tearDown() async throws { /* async teardown */ }
```


## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Test hangs | Waiting for an expectation/confirmation that never fires | Add timeout; verify the observation or confirmation path actually runs |
| Flaky test | Race condition in unstructured task | Use `withMainSerialExecutor` + `Task.yield()`, or restructure the API to be awaitable |
| Deadlock | Using `wait(for:)` in an async context | Use `await fulfillment(of:)` instead |
| Confirmation fails | Not awaiting async work before confirmation closure exits | Make the production API `async` or return its `Task` handle and `await task.value` |
| Actor isolation error in test | Test not marked with required actor | Add `@MainActor` (or appropriate actor) to the test |


## Swift Testing + Swift concurrency checklist

- Tests marked with correct isolation.
- Async methods properly awaited.
- Cancellation tested against real production cancellation checks.
- Memory leak checks for long-lived managers.
- Race conditions controlled with `withMainSerialExecutor` only when intermediate state must be observed.
- No fixed-delay `Task.sleep` used as synchronization.
- Thread Sanitizer enabled on a dedicated CI job.
