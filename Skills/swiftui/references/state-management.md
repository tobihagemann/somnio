# SwiftUI State Management Reference

## Property Wrapper Selection Guide

| Wrapper | Use When | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `@State` | Internal view state that triggers updates | Must be `private` |
| `@Binding` | Child view needs to modify parent's state | Don't use for read-only |
| `@Bindable` | iOS 17+: View receives `@Observable` object and needs bindings | For injected observables |
| `let` | Read-only value passed from parent | Simplest option |
| `var` | Read-only value that child observes via `.onChange()` | For reactive reads |

**Legacy (Pre-iOS 17):**
| Wrapper | Use When | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `@StateObject` | View owns an `ObservableObject` instance | Use `@State` with `@Observable` instead |
| `@ObservedObject` | View receives an `ObservableObject` from outside | Never create inline |

## @State

Always mark `@State` properties as `private`. Use for internal view state that triggers UI updates.

```swift
// Correct
@State private var isAnimating = false
@State private var selectedTab = 0
```

**Why Private?** Marking state as `private` makes it clear what's created by the view versus what's passed in. It also prevents accidentally passing initial values that will be ignored (see "Don't Pass Values as @State" below).

### iOS 17+ with @Observable (Preferred)

**Always prefer `@Observable` over `ObservableObject`.** With iOS 17's `@Observable` macro, use `@State` instead of `@StateObject`:

```swift
@Observable
@MainActor  // Always mark @Observable classes with @MainActor
final class DataModel {
    var name = "Some Name"
    var count = 0
}

struct MyView: View {
    @State private var model = DataModel()  // Use @State, not @StateObject

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField("Name", text: $model.name)
            Stepper("Count: \(model.count)", value: $model.count)
        }
    }
}
```

**Note**: You may want to mark `@Observable` classes with `@MainActor` to ensure thread safety with SwiftUI, unless your project or package uses Default Actor Isolation set to `MainActor`—in which case, the explicit attribute is redundant and can be omitted.

## Property Wrappers Inside @Observable Classes

The `@Observable` macro transforms stored properties to add observation tracking. Property wrappers (`@AppStorage`, `@SceneStorage`, `@Query`) also transform properties with their own storage. These two transformations conflict, so **annotate every property-wrapper property with `@ObservationIgnored` inside an `@Observable` class** — omitting it is a compile error.

```swift
@Observable
@MainActor
final class SettingsModel {
    // WRONG - compiler error: property wrapper conflicts with @Observable
    // @AppStorage("advancedLogLevel") var advancedLogLevel = "default"

    // CORRECT - @ObservationIgnored prevents the conflict
    @ObservationIgnored @AppStorage("advancedLogLevel") var advancedLogLevel = "default"

    var isLoading = false  // Regular stored properties work fine
}
```

`@AppStorage` still updates views through its own mechanism (UserDefaults KVO), so `@ObservationIgnored` doesn't lose reactivity here. Never remove it — that just restores the compile error.

## Make @Observable Property Types Equatable

The `@Observable` macro generates a setter that **skips invalidation when the new value equals the current one** — but only when the property's type is `Equatable`. Without that conformance, every assignment notifies observing views, even identical no-op writes. Make frequently-rewritten property types `Equatable` (a big win for game-loop / polling / per-tick state written with the same value each frame).

```swift
// AVOID: not Equatable — every assignment invalidates, even no-op writes
enum ConnectionPhase { case connecting, connected, degraded }

// PREFER: Equatable lets the generated setter short-circuit redundant writes
enum ConnectionPhase: Equatable { case connecting, connected, degraded }
```

Collections follow their element: an `Array`/`Set`/`Dictionary` is `Equatable` only when its element is, so a non-`Equatable` element defeats the short-circuit for the whole collection. This is distinct from `Equatable` *views* (which let SwiftUI skip a body) — this lets the model skip notifying observers in the first place.

## @Observable Dependency Granularity

Observation tracks reads at the **property** level, not the field level — reading any part of a compound property establishes a dependency on the whole thing. Three traps:

- **A computed property establishes dependencies transitively.** `var currentUser: User? { users.first { $0.id == currentID } }` reads `users`, so any view reading `currentUser` depends on the entire `users` array.
- **A struct-typed stored property drags the whole struct.** A view reading `session.user.name` depends on `session.user`; editing any other field of `user` invalidates it.
- **A collection read drags the whole collection.** Reading one element establishes a dependency on the entire stored collection.

Cache derived values as stored properties kept in sync, rather than recomputing in a getter:

```swift
@MainActor @Observable
final class AppState {
    var users: [User] = [] { didSet { recomputeCurrentUser() } }
    var currentID: User.ID? { didSet { recomputeCurrentUser() } }

    private(set) var currentUser: User?
    private func recomputeCurrentUser() { currentUser = users.first { $0.id == currentID } }
}
```

For struct-typed properties, expose the individual fields views actually read as separate properties (each is then tracked separately). Reading several already-narrow properties from one model is fine and needs no splitting.

## @Binding

Use only when child view needs to **modify** parent's state. If child only reads the value, use `let` instead.

```swift
// Parent
struct ParentView: View {
    @State private var isSelected = false

    var body: some View {
        ChildView(isSelected: $isSelected)
    }
}

// Child - will modify the value
struct ChildView: View {
    @Binding var isSelected: Bool

    var body: some View {
        Button("Toggle") {
            isSelected.toggle()
        }
    }
}
```

### When NOT to use @Binding

```swift
// Bad - child only displays, doesn't modify
struct DisplayView: View {
    @Binding var title: String  // Unnecessary
    var body: some View {
        Text(title)
    }
}

// Good - use let for read-only
struct DisplayView: View {
    let title: String
    var body: some View {
        Text(title)
    }
}
```

### Prefer KeyPath Bindings Over Closure Bindings

When you need a binding into a model, prefer a KeyPath/subscript-based binding (`$model.x`) over a hand-written `Binding(get:set:)` closure. A closure binding heap-allocates a new closure each time `body` runs and can't be compared, so it defeats equality checks and can trigger unnecessary invalidations.

```swift
// BAD - closure binding: heap allocation each body pass, defeats comparison
let binding = Binding(
    get: { model[scoreFor: player] },
    set: { model[scoreFor: player] = $0 }
)
PlayerScoreRow(player: player, score: binding)

// GOOD - project through a subscript with @Bindable
@Bindable var model = model
PlayerScoreRow(player: player, score: $model[scoreFor: player])
```

If no suitable subscript exists, add one. Reserve closure bindings for cases where no key path or subscript can express the transform.

## @StateObject vs @ObservedObject (Legacy - Pre-iOS 17)

**Note**: These are legacy patterns. Always prefer `@Observable` with `@State` for iOS 17+.

The key distinction is **ownership**:

- `@StateObject`: View **creates and owns** the object
- `@ObservedObject`: View **receives** the object from outside

```swift
// Legacy pattern - use @Observable instead
class MyViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var items: [String] = []
}

// View creates it → @StateObject
struct OwnerView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = MyViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        ChildView(viewModel: viewModel)
    }
}

// View receives it → @ObservedObject
struct ChildView: View {
    @ObservedObject var viewModel: MyViewModel

    var body: some View {
        List(viewModel.items, id: \.self) { Text($0) }
    }
}
```

### Common Mistake

Never create an `ObservableObject` inline with `@ObservedObject`:

```swift
// WRONG - creates new instance on every view update
struct BadView: View {
    @ObservedObject var viewModel = MyViewModel()  // BUG!
}

// CORRECT - owned objects use @StateObject
struct GoodView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = MyViewModel()
}
```

### @StateObject instantiation in View's initializer (if it's a Parent view)

This approach is an anti-pattern in general. Prefer storing the StateObject in the parent view or wherever the model is actually owned, then pass it down (use @ObservedObject, @EnvironmentObject, or @Bindable (for @Observable)) to keep ownership and lifecycle explicit.
If you need to create a @StateObject with initialization parameters in your view's custom initializer, be aware of redundant allocations and hidden side effects.

```swift
// WRONG - creates a new ViewModel instance each time the view's initializer is called
// (which can happen multiple times during SwiftUI's structural identity evaluation)
struct MovieDetailsView: View {
    
    @StateObject private var viewModel: MovieDetailsViewModel
    
    init(movie: Movie) {
        let viewModel = MovieDetailsViewModel(movie: movie)
        _viewModel = StateObject(wrappedValue: viewModel)      
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        // ...
    }
}

// CORRECT - creation in @autoclosure prevents multiple instantiations
struct MovieDetailsView: View {
    
    @StateObject private var viewModel: MovieDetailsViewModel
    
    init(movie: Movie) {
        _viewModel = StateObject(
            wrappedValue: MovieDetailsViewModel(movie: movie)
        )      
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Modern Alternative**: Use `@Observable` with `@State` instead of `ObservableObject` patterns.

## Don't Pass Values as @State

**Critical**: Never declare passed values as `@State` or `@StateObject`. The value you provide is only an initial value and won't update.

```swift
// Parent
struct ParentView: View {
    @State private var item = Item(name: "Original")
    
    var body: some View {
        ChildView(item: item)
        Button("Change") {
            item.name = "Updated"  // Child won't see this!
        }
    }
}

// Wrong - child ignores updates from parent
struct ChildView: View {
    @State var item: Item  // Accepts initial value only!
    
    var body: some View {
        Text(item.name)  // Shows "Original" forever
    }
}

// Correct - child receives updates
struct ChildView: View {
    let item: Item  // Or @Binding if child needs to modify
    
    var body: some View {
        Text(item.name)  // Updates when parent changes
    }
}
```

**Why**: `@State` and `@StateObject` retain values between view updates. That's their purpose. When a parent passes a new value, the child reuses its existing state.

**Prevention**: Always mark `@State` and `@StateObject` as `private`. This prevents them from appearing in the generated initializer.

## @Bindable (iOS 17+)

Use when receiving an `@Observable` object from outside and needing bindings:

```swift
@Observable
final class UserModel {
    var name = ""
    var email = ""
}

struct ParentView: View {
    @State private var user = UserModel()

    var body: some View {
        EditUserView(user: user)
    }
}

struct EditUserView: View {
    @Bindable var user: UserModel  // Received from parent, needs bindings

    var body: some View {
        Form {
            TextField("Name", text: $user.name)
            TextField("Email", text: $user.email)
        }
    }
}
```

## let vs var for Passed Values

### Use `let` for read-only display

```swift
struct ProfileHeader: View {
    let username: String
    let avatarURL: URL

    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            AsyncImage(url: avatarURL)
            Text(username)
        }
    }
}
```

### Use `var` when reacting to changes with `.onChange()`

```swift
struct ReactiveView: View {
    var externalValue: Int  // Watch with .onChange()
    @State private var displayText = ""

    var body: some View {
        Text(displayText)
            .onChange(of: externalValue) { oldValue, newValue in
                displayText = "Changed from \(oldValue) to \(newValue)"
            }
    }
}
```

## Environment and Preferences

### @Environment

Access environment values provided by SwiftUI or parent views:

```swift
struct MyView: View {
    @Environment(\.colorScheme) private var colorScheme
    @Environment(\.dismiss) private var dismiss

    var body: some View {
        Button("Done") { dismiss() }
            .foregroundStyle(colorScheme == .dark ? .white : .black)
    }
}
```

### Custom Environment Values with @Entry (hygiene)

Use the `@Entry` macro (Xcode 16+) to define custom environment values without `EnvironmentKey` boilerplate. Three rules keep them from causing spurious invalidations:

- **Never store a closure in a custom environment key.** SwiftUI can't compare function values, so any view reading a closure-valued key invalidates on *every* environment write. Wrapping the closure in a struct doesn't help. Defunctionalize: store the captured data as properties and expose behavior via `callAsFunction` or a method (or use an `@Observable` model). Framework action types (`\.openURL`, `\.dismiss`, `\.refresh`) are the intended exception.

  ```swift
  // AVOID: closure in a custom environment key
  extension EnvironmentValues { @Entry var submit: (String) -> Void = { _ in } }

  // PREFER: a defunctionalized struct
  struct SubmitAction { func callAsFunction(_ draft: String) { /* ... */ } }
  extension EnvironmentValues { @Entry var submit = SubmitAction() }
  ```

- **Keep `@Entry` defaults stable.** `@Entry` re-evaluates its default expression on every read that falls back to it. A fresh reference (`Model()`) or a runtime value (`Date()`, `UUID()`) makes readers using the default invalidate on every unrelated environment write. Back the default with a literal, enum case, `nil`, or a `static let`-backed instance.

- **Remove unused `@Environment` reads.** Declaring `@Environment(\.someKey)` subscribes the view to that key even if `body` never uses it, so every write re-evaluates the view for nothing. Delete unreferenced declarations. (The type form `@Environment(Model.self)` tracks at the property level and carries no such cost.)

### @Environment with @Observable (iOS 17+ - Preferred)

**Always prefer this pattern** for sharing state through the environment:

```swift
@Observable
@MainActor
final class AppState {
    var isLoggedIn = false
}

// Inject
ContentView()
    .environment(AppState())

// Access
struct ChildView: View {
    @Environment(AppState.self) private var appState
}
```

### @EnvironmentObject (Legacy - Pre-iOS 17)

Legacy pattern for sharing observable objects through the environment:

```swift
// Legacy pattern - use @Observable with @Environment instead
class AppState: ObservableObject {
    @Published var isLoggedIn = false
}

// Inject at root
ContentView()
    .environmentObject(AppState())

// Access in child
struct ChildView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var appState: AppState
}
```

## Decision Flowchart

```
Is this value owned by this view?
├─ YES: Is it a simple value type?
│       ├─ YES → @State private var
│       └─ NO (class):
│           ├─ Use @Observable → @State private var (mark class @MainActor)
│           └─ Legacy ObservableObject → @StateObject private var
│
└─ NO (passed from parent):
    ├─ Does child need to MODIFY it?
    │   ├─ YES → @Binding var
    │   └─ NO: Does child need BINDINGS to its properties?
    │       ├─ YES (@Observable) → @Bindable var
    │       └─ NO: Does child react to changes?
    │           ├─ YES → var + .onChange()
    │           └─ NO → let
    │
    └─ Is it a legacy ObservableObject from parent?
        └─ YES → @ObservedObject var (consider migrating to @Observable)
```

## State Privacy Rules

**All view-owned state should be `private`:**

```swift
// Correct - clear what's created vs passed
struct MyView: View {
    // Created by view - private
    @State private var isExpanded = false
    @State private var viewModel = ViewModel()
    @AppStorage("theme") private var theme = "light"
    @Environment(\.colorScheme) private var colorScheme
    
    // Passed from parent - not private
    let title: String
    @Binding var isSelected: Bool
    @Bindable var user: User
    
    var body: some View {
        // ...
    }
}
```

**Why**: This makes dependencies explicit and improves code completion for the generated initializer.

## Avoid Nested ObservableObject

**Note**: This limitation only applies to `ObservableObject`. `@Observable` fully supports nested observed objects.

```swift
// Avoid - breaks animations and change tracking
class Parent: ObservableObject {
    @Published var child: Child  // Nested ObservableObject
}

class Child: ObservableObject {
    @Published var value: Int
}

// Workaround - pass child directly to views
struct ParentView: View {
    @StateObject private var parent = Parent()
    
    var body: some View {
        ChildView(child: parent.child)  // Pass nested object directly
    }
}

struct ChildView: View {
    @ObservedObject var child: Child
    
    var body: some View {
        Text("\(child.value)")
    }
}
```

**Why**: SwiftUI can't track changes through nested `ObservableObject` properties. Manual workarounds break animations. With `@Observable`, this isn't an issue.

## Key Principles

1. **Always prefer `@Observable` over `ObservableObject`** for new code
2. **Mark `@Observable` classes with `@MainActor` for thread safety (unless using default actor isolation)`**
3. Use `@State` with `@Observable` classes (not `@StateObject`)
4. Use `@Bindable` for injected `@Observable` objects that need bindings
5. **Always mark `@State` and `@StateObject` as `private`**
6. **Never declare passed values as `@State` or `@StateObject`**
7. With `@Observable`, nested objects work fine; with `ObservableObject`, pass nested objects directly to child views
8. **Always add `@ObservationIgnored` to property wrappers** (`@AppStorage`, `@SceneStorage`, `@Query`) inside `@Observable` classes — they conflict with the macro
9. **Prefer `Equatable` types for frequently-written `@Observable` properties** so the generated setter skips redundant invalidations
10. **Never store closures in custom environment keys; keep `@Entry` defaults stable** (no `Model()`/`Date()` expressions); remove unused `@Environment` reads
11. **Prefer KeyPath/subscript bindings (`$model.x`) over closure bindings**
